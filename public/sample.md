# **Chapter 1: The Mysterious Map**

In the heart of the bustling city of New Haven, there lived a young historian named Elara. She had always been fascinated by ancient civilizations and spent most of her days in the grand library, poring over old manuscripts and artifacts. One rainy afternoon, while she was examining a newly acquired collection of books, a small, leather-bound journal caught her attention.

As she carefully opened the fragile journal, a folded piece of parchment fell out. It was a map, unlike any she had seen before, filled with strange symbols and markings. Intrigued, Elara decided to embark on a journey to decipher the map and discover its secrets.

## **Chapter 2: The Journey Begins**

Elara's quest took her to distant lands, each with its unique challenges and wonders. Her first stop was the ancient city of Cairo. The hustle and bustle of the city were overwhelming, but she found solace in the historic libraries and museums where she researched the symbols on the map.

It was in Cairo that Elara met Amin, a young archaeologist who shared her passion for ancient mysteries. Together, they deciphered part of the map, which pointed them towards the Himalayas.

## **Chapter 3: Among the Peaks**

The Himalayan air was thin, and the mountains towered above them like ancient guardians. After days of trekking, Elara and Amin came across a secluded monastery, where monks held knowledge passed down through generations.

It was here that they learned about the Legend of the Sun Stone, a mystical artifact believed to possess immense power. The map, they realized, was a guide to finding this lost treasure.

## **Chapter 4: The Lost City**

Guided by the map, Elara and Amin journeyed through dense jungles and crossed treacherous rivers. Their journey led them to a forgotten city, hidden by time and nature. The city was filled with incredible architecture and strange, undecipherable writings.

As they explored this lost city, they discovered that the civilization that built it had a deep understanding of astronomy and the natural world. This knowledge was key to finding the Sun Stone.

## **Chapter 5: The Chamber of Secrets Bello We Are Testing Overflow**

Deep within the city, Elara and Amin found a hidden chamber, marked by the same symbols that were on the map. The chamber was a puzzle, filled with intricate mechanisms and ancient inscriptions.

After days of studying and trial, they unlocked the chamber, revealing a path leading deep underground. Following it, they came upon a room bathed in golden light.

## **Chapter 6: The Sun Stone**

There, in the center of the room, sat the Sun Stone. It was more magnificent than either Elara or Amin had imagined, glowing with an inner light. As Elara approached the stone, she felt a surge of energy, and visions of the ancient world filled her mind.

She understood then that the Sun Stone was not just a treasure, but a repository of knowledge, containing the wisdom of a lost civilization.

## **Chapter 7: The Return**

With the Sun Stone in their possession, Elara and Amin made their way back to civilization. They were determined to share their findings with the world, to bring the knowledge of this ancient civilization to light.

However, they also knew that such power needed to be protected. They decided to keep the location of the lost city a secret, to preserve its mysteries for future generations.

## **Epilogue: A New Beginning**

Elara returned to New Haven, where her journey had begun. She continued her work as a historian, enriched by the incredible experience and the knowledge she had gained. The map and the Sun Stone were carefully preserved, symbols of the endless mysteries waiting to be uncovered in our world.

Elara often looked back on her journey, knowing that it was just the beginning of her lifelong quest to unravel the secrets of the past and share them with the world.

# The Joke Tax Chronicles

Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.

## The King's Plan

The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with [a brilliant plan](#): he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.

> "After all," he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair that they should pay for the privilege."

### The Joke Tax

The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the king was firm:

- 1st level of puns: 5 gold coins
- 2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins
- 3rd level of one-liners: 20 gold coins

As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king's foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.

### Jokester's Revolt

Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to stop Jokester.

And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.

### The People's Rebellion

The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the joke.

The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the error of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a hero, and the kingdom lived happily ever after.

The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good laugh and always be careful of bad ideas.

### `add`

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add
```

The `add` command is now much more capable. You can now add UI components but also import more complex components (coming soon).

The CLI will automatically resolve all components and dependencies, format them based on your custom config and add them to your project.

### `diff` (experimental)

```bash
npx shadcn-ui diff
```

```diff /pl-12/
const alertVariants = cva(
- "relative w-full rounded-lg border",
+ "relative w-full pl-12 rounded-lg border"
